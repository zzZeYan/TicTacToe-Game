# Readme for TicTacToe Game


## Overall Description

This is a TicTacToe Game with the whole software lifecycle: designing, developing, testing, and iterating upon a digital rendition. 

Three group members participate in the process above. 


## Group Members

Jiahui Zhou(Leader of the Project, GitHub account: zzZeYan)

Dapeng Gan(GitHub account: Dapeng-Gan)

## User Stories

US1. As a player, I want to be able to make a move by choosing an empty square, so that I can place my symbol on the board.

US2. As a player, I want to be able to see the current state of the game, so that I can keep track of the moves made by both myself and my opponent.

US3. As a player, I want to be notified when the game has ended in a win, loss or draw, so that I can see the result of the game.

US4. As a player, I want to be able to start a new game after the current game has ended, so that I can play again.


## Tasks
1. Create a GitHub repository (public)

2. Create a GitHub project and link it to the created repository

3. Transfer the user stories to a new Kanban board in the project

4. Give every user story a unique id

5. Create a new Java Maven project

6. Initialize a new git repository

7. Set the GitHub repository as a remote repository

8. Commit and push your blank Java project to the main branch

9. Protect the main branch (only allow pull requests)

10. Start working on the user stories

11. Create a new feature branch for every user story and name it correctly

12. Merge the branch after completion via pull request

13. Make sure the CI/CD tests your code before merging

14. Always advance the user stories on the Kanban board

15. The main branch should "deploy" the application via CI/CD (make the jar downloadable)


## Execution

1. Method one: Open the Java Maven project, enter the TicTacToeDriver class and run the main method. 

2. Method two: enter the target directory, execute the command: java -jar TicTacToeGame-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Based on any of two methods above, you can experience the process of game. 

Enjoy yourself!

## Achievements

(1) Includes screenshots of the Software Lifecycle

(2) Include descriptions of the Software Lifecycle

       e.g. Kanban Board, feature branch, pull request, ...
            What are your actions after a user story is assigned to you?
            Exemplary process for one user story is enough

(3) Includes link to the **public** GitHub repository

**2. Git**

(1) Use correct branches and branch names

(2) use correct commits and commit messages

**3. Implementation**

(1) Application is runnable

(2) All requirements are implemented

**4. Testing**

(1) Every method has at least two unit tests

(2) Positives and negative test cases are used

(3) Includes necessary pom.xml configuration

**5. DevOps**

(1) Kanban board is used to manage user stories ?

(2) **Pull requests**

(3) Tests are run automatically on each feature branch push

(4) .jar file on **each** main branch merge
